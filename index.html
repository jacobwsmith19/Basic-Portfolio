                    Hello! My name is Jake and I'm currently enrolled in UT Coding Bootcamp. This portfolio page highlights some of the projects I've wored on.
                    The "Portfolio" tab has links to these projects. The "Contact" tab has a link to my resume, email, and LinkedIn account. Lastly, the picture over
                    here on the left has Leo, my Australian Shepherd. I picked him so that I could have a running companion while training for a marathon. As it turns out,
                    Leo refuses to run, and prefers to hide under the bed while I'm running through the hills of Austin.

                    Pretty sure I have the world's most athletic lapdog.
